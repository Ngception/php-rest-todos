# PHP REST TODOS API

A learning exercise in writting a basic REST API using PHP as a beginner without any libraries or frameworks.

Currently, performs basic CRUD operations to fetch, update, and delete.

## Setup
Uses [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) Apache distribution that includes MariaDB, PHP, and Perl.

For development with hot reloading, uses the [VSCode Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in conjunction with the [Live Server web extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-server-web-extension/fiegdmejfepffgpnejdinekhfieaogmj?hl=en-US).

To connect to the database, credentials are provided through environment variables.

## Usage
All requests can be made to `http://localhost/php-rest-todos/api/*.php`
